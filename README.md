# Text-Classification-on-movie-reviews-using-Logistic-Regression
In these days all are showing interest to read the online reviews. These reviews could be movie reviews, product reviews, restaurant reviews etc. But there will be bulk of reviews in online. Reading those much of bulk of reviews is not possible within short span of time.So I created a M/L model which can classify those reviews as positive or negative.


# Steps involved in classifying the reviews

step1:  Importing the libraries      
step2:  Importing the dataset    
step3:  Persisting the dataset      
step4:  Preprocessing the data      
step5:  Converting the data into Bag of words model    
step6:  Transforming the bag of words model into TF-IDF model    
step7:  Splitting the data into training and testing data     
step8:  Training the classifier using logistic regression model    
step9:  Testing the model performance     
step10: Saving our model in pickle files
